Elevator pitch:
For	(people)
Who	(goals)
This	(provides value) ->	Features (ie. Map/Location/Beer Location)(UI, GPS, JSON, DB)


Technology Stack (language/framework & dev)
Knowns(things taught in class, etc.)
Unknowns(things you want to learn)

Admin U/I->update database, need GPS (extra goal: deliver JSON apiâ€”so instead of returning html view template, return json view template)
